I added some code to check and make sure that the server can talk to the
Internet before checking hosts.  
<p>
This is a postgres version of Uptime, which Arsdigita ran until
June, 2001.  This <a href="http://openacs.org/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=0001tT&topic_id=11&topic=OpenACS">thread</a> over at <a href="http://www.openacs.org">OpenACS</a>'s forums started it.
<p>

I download the uptime source code from 
<a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/free-tools/uptime.19990404.tar.gz">
Arsdigita</a> and made a few changes and it currently is running
at 

<p>

<a href="http://uptime.openacs.org">http://uptime.openacs.org</a>.

<p>

<a href="http://uptime.openacs.org/uptime/doc/uptime-current.tar.gz">Current Code</a> presently at versioin 0.1.

<p>

The following was done to make it work:
<ul> 
<li>Ported the data-model.sql to postgresql and grabbed to postgres.sql
data model from the <a href="http://www.openacs.org">OpenACS</a> to 
get some of the "oracle-isms" that are required.  <a href="http://uptime.openacs.org/uptime/doc/sql">SQL data models</a> currently in use.</li>
<li>You need Phil G's <a href="http://www.arsdigita.com/books/panda/utilities.txt">utilites.tcl</a> for this to work.
<li>I change the director structure around a bit, mainly so it was a bit
more familar with it.  The private TCL library is no longer under
the web root.</li>
<li>Removed some of the "oracle-isms" from the .tcl code.  unique -> distinct.
Changed all sysdate to sysdate(), etc.
</ul>

You also need <a href="http://aolserver.com">AOLserver</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>

<p>

A couple ideas for uptime (my own and from others):

<ul>
<li>Make the code more DB indepentant and create data models for Sybase,
Adabas, etc.</li>
<li>Distributed servers across multiple servers.  This would be quite
an interesting hack.</li>
</ul>
