uptime
======

This is a postgresql based version of Phil Grenspun's Uptime 
(http://philip.greenspun.com/research/monitoring) that OpenACS use to 
provide. The site seems unresponive now (20141208). 

This was the orginal code that I yanked when PhilG's service was shutdown.

I plan on tweaking it and clean it up a bit. But, I noticed that the code
has seem to have been lost.
